		<div class="col-sm-8 col-12 mb-4 mt-4">
			Our community is open to anyone interested in citizen science - our vision
			for the platform is to encourage the democratization of science via the wide
			establishment and appreciation of citizen science approaches across Europe.<br/><br/>
			We hope to become the central reference point for anyone setting up or running a citizen
			science project - such as practitioners, researchers, educators, communities and citizens,
			anyone supporting the ecosystem of citizen science projects - such as policy makers and funding bodies,
			and anyone interested in the outcomes and impact of citizen science - such as decision makers,
			the press, and society as a whole. It doesn’t matter if you have years of experience or are completely
			new to citizen science.<br/><br/>
			You can read more about our assessment of our stakeholders,
			community members, and target audience in
			the project <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3465726">Stakeholders,Network & Community Mapping Report</a>
			and in the project <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3466417">Engagement and Community- building Plan.</a>

				This alpha release of the platform (launched in April 2020) has a
				<a href="/resources">Resources section</a> where you can browse and search for resources that are useful for planning
				and running citizen science projects, and
				a <a href="/projects">projects section</a> where you can browse and search
				for citizen science projects to learn from other’s experience and collaborate. If you sign up
				as a member of the community, you will be able to follow projects, add resources to your library,
				and add your own projects and resources to those sections.<br/><br/>

			No, we don’t host any documents, files, or software on our own platform. When a profile is created for a
			resource, it points to the location where that resource is stored or published, and project profiles
			point to the external website of that project. We strongly recommend the use of permanent repositories
			and permalinks, so that links do not become broken over time.

				The resource should be relevant to the initiation, planning, execution, or closure of citizen science projects,

				The resource should also meet a range of quality factors such as whether it is easy to access, is structured clearly,
				is easy to read (or hear or view), and easy to understand. Read our Quality Guidelines <a href="#quality"> here</a>.

			Encouraging Permalinks: In the form for submitting resources, alongside the metadata field for the link to the resource, we will strongly encourage
			the use of permalinks from hosting repositories such as <a href="https://zenodo.org">Zenodo</a>, <a href="https://osf.io/">OSF</a> or the
			<a href="https://riojournal.com/">RIO Journal</a> that create a permanent DOI for the resource, and support version management.
			<ul>
				<li>Users will be warned that resources with broken links will be delisted, but they can update the links from their resource dashboard at any time.</li>
				<li>When a resource is delisted, the person who submitted it will receive an email informing them of this, the reason, and how they can address the issue and resubmit the resource.</li>
			</ul>
			Flagging Resources: All resources can be flagged by the community as having an issue that needs addressing, which includes broken links. These will then be delisted and the submitter
			of the resource will be informed about how to address the issue and encouraged to resubmit it.<br/><br/>
			Deadlink Checker: we will integrate a script to run software that checks for broken links such as Broken Link Checker by W-Shadow on a regular basis - likely once a month for the first year,
			and once a quarter thereafter. (Links go dead over a matter of years, not months, as server-support often gets pulled approximately 2-3 years after a project ends)

				Resource Dashboard: The registered user who has submitted a Resource has access to the Resource profiles that they have created via a dashboard.
				Resources can be updated at any time by providing a link to a new document. If the Resource is hosted on a platform such as Zenodo or OSF,
				then the version management can happen at that location and the link and DOI will remain constant. It is up to the community to keep their resources up to date.<br/><br/>
				Flagging Resources: All resources can be flagged by the community as having an issue that needs addressing, which includes resources that appear to be outdated.
				These will then be delisted and the submitter of the resource will be informed about how to address the issue and resubmit.<br/><br/>

				<h4>What is Citizen Science?</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-8 col-12 mb-4 mt-4">
				Citizen science actively involves the public in scientific research
				that generates new knowledge or understanding, and thus has the potential
				to bring together science, policy makers, and society as a whole in an impactful way.<br/><br/>
				As a core dimension of Open Science, it opens up the opportunity for all members of society
				to take an active role in research, innovation and the development of evidence-based policy,
				at local, national and EU levels. Citizen scientists can participate in many stages of the
				scientific process, from data collection and volunteer mapping, through data interpretation
				and analysis, to publication and dissemination of results.<br/><br/>
				Citizen science is a flexible concept which can be adapted and applied within diverse situations
				and disciplines, and represents a range of approaches and historical practices for public participation
				in scientific research. As a result, there are a range of definitions of citizen science,
				as can be seen in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science">Wikipedia entry for Citizen Science.</a><br/><br/>
				A set of key principles that underlie good practice in citizen science -  the <a href="/about#ten">10 Principles of Citizen Science</a> - has been developed
				by the ‘Sharing best practice and building capacity’ working group of the European Citizen Science Association,
				led by the Natural History Museum London with input from many members of the Association.
