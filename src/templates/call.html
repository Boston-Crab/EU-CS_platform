			<h3>EU-Citizen.Science Call</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-8 col-12 mt-4 mb-4">
			The EU-Citizen.Science Call will fund the <b>development, implementation and testing of 10 training modules</b> 
			on the topic of citizen science. These modules will be uploaded to the Moodle integration of the EU-Citizen.Science platform. 
			Please refer to section 3 “Scope of the Call” in the Guide for Applicants to read the themes and the suggested topics of the training modules.
			<br/><br/>
			Training modules are self-directed, 1 or 2 hours units that a learner can study at her own pace and receive a badge and a 
			certificate upon completion. The system is based on the education content management system Moodle (see here). 
			We are estimating the effort of designing and developing a training unit at about 7-10 working days.<br/><br/>

			Module designers are expected to:
			<ul>
				<li>develop the module content using the guidelines of the EU-Citizen.Science platform (see link below);</li>

				<li>create a template for the module on the EU-Citizen.Science platform using Moodle, and upload all the content;</li>

				<li>undertake user-testing of the module and implement changes where necessary with at least five members of the intended audience.</li>
			</ul>

			All guidance, templates etc. to help with the design of module content and uploading it to Moodle will be provided 
			upon successful award of the grant. The preliminary module development guidelines document (here) and content template (here) 
			are available for download.<br/><br/>

			Please refer to section 7 “Requirements” of the Guide for Applicants to see all the requirements for a training module. Some of these requirements are: 
			<ul>

				<li>Each module should contain 5-8 sections, which must include the standard “Welcome and introduction”, “Conclusion and self-assessment”, 
					“Further information and learning” and “Sources and acknowledgements”.</li>

				<li>Modules can be prepared in any European language, but the application needs to be in English.</li>

				<li>Each section of the module must end with a short activity or quiz to test student understanding of the section content. This is formative assessment, which allows the student to assess their progression and their understanding of key concepts.</li>
			</ul>
