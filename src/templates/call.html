			<h3>Task description</h3>

		<div class="col-sm-8 col-12 mb-4">
			The EU-Citizen.Science Call will fund the <b>development, implementation and testing of 10 training modules</b> 
			on the topic of citizen science. These modules will be uploaded to the <a href="https://moodle.eu-citizen.science">Moodle integration</a> of the EU-Citizen.Science platform. 
			Please refer to section 3 “Scope of the Call” in the Guide for Applicants to read the themes and the suggested topics of the training modules.
			<br/><br/>
			Training modules are self-directed, 1 or 2 hours units that a learner can study at her own pace and receive a badge and a 
			certificate upon completion. The system is based on the education content management system Moodle. 
			We are estimating the effort of designing and developing a training unit at about 7-10 working days.<br/><br/>

			Module designers are expected to:
			<ul>
				<li>develop the module content using the guidelines of the EU-Citizen.Science platform (see link below);</li>

				<li>create a template for the module on the EU-Citizen.Science platform using Moodle, and upload all the content;</li>

				<li>undertake user-testing of the module and implement changes where necessary with at least five members of the intended audience.</li>
			</ul>

			All guidance, templates etc. to help with the design of module content and uploading it to Moodle will be provided 
			upon successful award of the grant. The preliminary 
			<a href="{%static 'site/files/EU-Cit.Sci_Training_module_design_guidelines_v1.pdf' %}">module development guidelines document</a> and 
			<a href="{%static 'site/files/EU-Cit.Sci_Content_Design_Template.pdf' %}">content template</a>
			are available for download.<br/><br/>

			Please refer to section 7 “Requirements” of the Guide for Applicants to see all the requirements for a training module. Some of these requirements are: 
			<ul>

				<li>Each module should contain 5-8 sections, which must include the standard “Welcome and introduction”, “Conclusion and self-assessment”, 
					“Further information and learning” and “Sources and acknowledgements”.</li>

				<li>Modules can be prepared in any European language, but the application needs to be in English.</li>

				<li>Each section of the module must end with a short activity or quiz to test student understanding of the section content. This is formative assessment, which allows the student to assess their progression and their understanding of key concepts.</li>
			</ul>
